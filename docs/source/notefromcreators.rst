Note From The Creators
=====

.. _notefromcreators:

When Ambit Sentry was conceptualised by its three founders, our vision was to build an SDP solution that would simplify developing, implementing and managing a Zero Trust Strategy. To do this, we set our selves some challenging design objectives. We know that data/assets/resources do not only reside in the cloud, but in multiple locations and across multiple domains i.e., ICS, IoT etc. To address this, we had to design a secure solution that would reside on the host that the solution is protecting while consuming as little resources on that host.  


We took a very early view that if we are going to assist clients develop and implement a ZT strategy, we cannot ask the client to “Trust” us with there data. It is a ZT Strategy after all. This meant that we had to design a solution that is simple to use and completely client deployed and managed where we never have access to the client data or systems. 


We placed a high level of importance on our solution being completely heterogenous and should seamlessly integrate into other systems such as SIEM’s.   


We are proud to say that we have achieved all our design objectives with our: 

    Ambit Sentry Security Framework – “Simple – Seamless – Secure”. 


On that note, lets move on to the cool stuff….. 



Introduction To The Ambit Sentry Security Framework
---------------------------------------------------

The Ambit Sentry Security Framework is composed of 4 components each performing a specific function. The 4 components are: 

    Ambit Port - Provides Cloaking, Authorisation and Authentication services to any single or multiple Ports residing on any Virtual Machine (Host). Built-in policy engine enables policy creation on the host. 

    Ambit Agent - Provides Cloaking, Authorisation and Authentication services to any Virtual Machine (Host) thereby providing the above services to ALL the ports on the host. Built-in policy engine enables policy creation on the host. 

    Ambit InSights - Is the ASSF’s IDS and IPS component that resides in front of the host, capturing packet flows, IP Addresses, Ports and Protocols in real-time flowing into and out of the host. Built-in policy engine enables policy creation on the host using the IPS functionality. 

    Ambit Management Console (AMC) - A customized platform to manage and display port, agent and insights data. 

Note: Each component within the framework functions independently from each other or together as your requirement dictates. 

 
Implementation Notes
--------------------

While the Ambit Sentry Security Framework is designed to be completely heterogenous, we recommend that you set yourself no limitations or boundaries in terms of where or how you deploy the ASSF. We encourage our clients to find different and new ways of utilising the ASSF. We are very open to exploring how we can adapt the ASSF to address a specific need you may have as the ASSF is completely customisable.  


Please use our communication channels listed below for any suggestions, recommendations, complaints or compliments or if you just want to bounce an idea around. We look forward to hearing from you. 


Licensing Model 
---------------

The ASSF uses a monthly licensing subscription model that is billed annually and paid in advance. Our subscription model makes provision for a “Pay-Per-Use” model which allows the user to protect a single or multiple ports on a host using the Ambit Port Solution or the user could protect the entire Host using the Ambit Agent Solution.
